Create an app to fetch UK power generation carbon mix 
=====================================================

Thank you for showing interest in working with us!

The following test is used to gauge your technical ability and is a precursor to an interview here. You have seven days to complete this task, and you should work with your representative for more information should you need it.

## Intro

We're building a new app for displaying the carbon intensity of UK Electric power generation, using the https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk API.

## Specification

Your task is to create a mobile app that will work on either Android or iOS mobile devices.  

* Fetch 'forecast carbon intensity index' data from `https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/regional/intensity/{from}/fw24h` where the `from` date is the current date time.
* For each UK region, display the intensity index.
* Use the appropriate view for the chosen platform.  The results should be scrollable.
* Allow the selection of a region to show more detailed information.

Since we are a tech-first company, and service will be business critical, we expect this service to include tests to ensure quality and maintenance.

## Notes

* You do not have to follow the spec blindly provided you can explain any modifications.
